You may be familiar with the acronym NISQ. Each letter summarizes important
information about the properties of current quantum computers: intermediate-scale
(IS) describes their size, Q is for quantum, and N reminds us that we shouldn't forget about noise.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to simulate noisy circuits using built-in functionality in
PennyLane. We'll cover the basics of noisy channels and density matrices, then use example code to
simulate circuits with noise. PennyLane has the unique feature that it is possible to compute
gradients of noisy channels. You'll learn how to employ this feature to retrieve noisy parameters
describing experimental data. We're putting the N in NISQ.

# Noisy operations
# ----------------
# Noise is any unwanted transformation that corrupts the intended
# output of a quantum computation. It can be separated into two categories. Coherent
# noise is described by unitary operations that maintain the purity of the output quantum state.
# A common source are systematic errors originating from imperfectly-calibrated devices that do
# not exactly apply desired gates. Incoherent noise is more problematic: it describes how a quantum
# computer becomes entangled with the environment, resulting in
# mixed states as outputs. Informally, incoherent noise leads to
# outputs that are always random, regardless of what basis we measure in!
#
# Mixed states are best described as *density matrices*, which require a
# different method for simulating quantum computations. This is the purpose of PennyLane's
# `default.mixed` device. Instead of using a vector representation of quantum states,
# `default.mixed` represents all states as density matrices, providing native support for mixed
# states and for simulating all types of noise. Let's look at a simple circuit for preparing the
# Bell state :math:`|\psi\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle+|11\rangle)`. We ask the QNode to
# return the expectation value of :math:`Z_0\otimes Z_1`:
#
import pennylane as qml
from pennylane import numpy as np

dev = qml.device('default.mixed', wires=2)
ZZ = qml.PauliZ(0)@qml.PauliZ(1)

    qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
    qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
    return qml.expval(ZZ)

# projector :math:`|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|`

######################################################################
# Just as mixed states are represented by density matrices, incoherent noise is modelled by
# *quantum channels*, which are linear, completely positive, and trace-preserving (`CPTP
# <https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/channel-cp-map>`__) maps. A convenient strategy for representing
# quantum channels is to employ Kraus operators :math:`K = \{K_i\}` satisfying the condition
# :math:`\sum_i K_{i}^{\dagger} K_i = \mathcal{I}`. From an initial state :math:`\rho`, the output
# state after the action of a channel :math:`E` is:
#
# .. math::
#
#     \rho' = E(\rho) = \sum_i K_i \rho K_{i}^{\dagger}.
#
# The action of a quantum channel can thus be interpreted as applying the transformation
# :math:`K_i` with probability :math:`p_i = \text{Tr}[K_i \rho K_{i}^{\dagger}]`. Consider the
# bit flip channel. It describes a transformation that flips the state of a qubit with
# probability :math:`p`. Its Kraus operators are
#
# .. math::
#
#     K_0 = (1-p)\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}
#     K_1 = p\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}
#
# This channel can be implemented in PennyLane using the :func:`~.pennylane.BitFlip` operation.
# Let's see what happens when we simulate this type of noise in the previous circuit,
# with different bit flip probabilitites
#

# The circuit behaves quite differently in the presence of noise! This will be familiar to anyone
# that has run an algorithm on quantum hardware, and it motivates why error mitigation and error
# correction are so important.
#
# Besides the bit flip channel, PennyLane supports several other noisy channels that are commonly
# used to describe experimental imperfections: :func:`~.pennylane.PhaseFlip`,
# :func:`~.pennylane.AmplitudeDamping`, # :func:`~.pennylane.GeneralizedAmplitudeDamping`,
# :func:`~.pennylane.PhaseDamping`, and the :func:`~.pennylane.DepolarizingChannel`. You can also
# build your own custom channel using the operation :func:`~.pennylane.QubitChannel` by
# specifying its Kraus matrices. For example, the depolarizing channel is a generalization of
# the bit flip and phase flip channels, where each of the three possible Pauli errors can be
# applied to a single qubit. A circuit modelling the effect of depolarizing noise in
# preparing a Bell state is implemented below

# Modelling the noise that occurs in real experiments requires careful consideration. PennyLane
# offers the flexibility to experiment with different combinations of noisy channels to mimic the
# performance of quantum algorithms when deployed on real devices.
#
# Channel gradients
# -----------------
#
# The ability to compute gradients of any operation is an essential ingredient of differentiable
# quantum programming. In PennyLane, it is possible to
# compute gradients of noisy channels and optimize them inside variational circuits. Analytical
# gradients exist for channels whose Kraus operators are proportional to unitary
# matrices [cite]. In other cases, gradients are evaluated using finite difference.
#
# To illustrate this property, we'll consider an elementary example and train the noise parameters
# of a circuit to reproduce an
# observed expectation value. Suppose that we run the circuit to prepare a Bell state
# on a hardware device and observe that the expectation value of :math:`Z_0\otimes Z_1` is
# equal to 0.7781. In the experiment, it is known that the major source of noise is amplitude
# damping, as would happen for example due to photon loss. This process projects a state to
# :math:`|0\rangle` with probability :math:`p`. What damping parameter explains this
# outcome?
#
# We answer this question by optimizing the channel parameters to reproduce the experimental
# observation. Since the parameter :math:`p` is a probability, we use a sigmoid function to
# ensure that the trainable parameters give rise to a valid channel parameter.
#
ev = 0.7781

# help you design, simulate, and optimize noisy quantum circuits. We look forward to seeing what
# the quantum community can achieve with them!
